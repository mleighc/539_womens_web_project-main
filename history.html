        <h2>Susan B. Anthony</h2>
        <img src="images/susan_ba.jpg" width="200" alt="Headshot of Susan B. Anthony">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Susan B. Anthony was an American social reformer and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the
          women's suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery
          petitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery
          Society.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting in her hometown of Rochester, New York, and convicted in a widely
          publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action. In
          1878, Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women
          the right to vote. Introduced by Sen. Aaron A. Sargent (R-CA), it later became known colloquially as the Susan
          B. Anthony Amendment. It was ratified as the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Elizabeth Cady Stanton</h2>
        <img src="images/elizabeth_cady_s.jpg" width="200" alt="Headshot of Elizabeth Cady Stanton">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Elizabeth Cady Stanton was an American suffragist, social activist, abolitionist, and leading figure of the
          early
          women's rights movement. Her Declaration of Sentiments, presented at the Seneca Falls Convention held in 1848
          in
          Seneca Falls, New York, is often credited with initiating the first organized women's rights and women's
          suffrage
          movements in the United States. Stanton was president of the National Woman Suffrage Association from 1892
          until
          1900.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike many of those involved in the women's rights movement, Stanton addressed various issues pertaining to
          women
          beyond voting rights. Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment
          and
          income rights, divorce, the economic health of the family, and birth control.

        <h2>Jeannette Rankin</h2>
        <img src="images/jeannette_rankin.jpg" width="200" alt="Headshot of Jeannette Rankin">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Jeannette Rankin was an American politician and women's rights advocate, and the first woman to hold federal
          office in the United States. She was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from Montana in 1916, and
          again
          in 1940. She remains the only woman elected to Congress by Montana.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each of Rankin's Congressional terms coincided with initiation of U.S. military intervention in each of the
          two
          world wars. A lifelong pacifist, she was one of 50 House members, along with six Senators, who opposed the war
          declaration of 1917, and the only member of Congress to vote against declaring war on Japan after the attack
          on
          Pearl Harbor in 1941.
        </p>

        <p>
          A member of the Republican Party during the Progressive Era, Rankin was also instrumental in initiating the
          legislation that eventually became the 19th Constitutional Amendment, granting unrestricted voting rights to
          women. In her victory speech, she recognized the power she held as the only woman able to vote in Congress,
          saying
          "I am deeply conscious of the responsibility resting upon me". She championed the causes of women's rights and
          civil rights throughout a career that spanned more than six decades.

          Debra Anne Haaland is an American attorney and politician serving as the U.S. Representative for New Mexico's
          1st
          congressional district. The district includes almost three-fourths of Albuquerque, along with most of that
          city's
          suburbs.
        </p>

        <p>
          She and Sharice Davids are the first two Native American women elected to the U.S. Congress. Haaland is a
          former

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Geraldine Anne Ferraro (August 26, 1935 – March 26, 2011) was an American politician, diplomat, and attorney.
          She
          served in the United States House of Representatives from 1979 to 1985, and was the Democratic Party's vice
          presidential nominee in the 1984 presidential election, running alongside Walter Mondale; this made her the
          first
          female vice-presidential nominee representing a major American political party. She was also a journalist,
          author,
          and businesswoman.</p>



        <p>In 1984, former vice president and presidential candidate Walter Mondale, seen as an underdog, selected
          Ferraro
          to be his running mate in the upcoming election. In doing so Ferraro also became the first widely recognized
          Italian American to be a major-party national nominee. The positive polling the Mondale-Ferraro ticket
          received
          when she joined soon faded, as damaging questions arose about her and her businessman husband's finances and
          wealth and her Congressional disclosure statements. In the general election, Mondale and Ferraro were defeated
          in
          a landslide by incumbent President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George H. W. Bush.

        <h2>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h2>
        <img src="images/rbg.jpg" width="200" alt="Headshot of Ruth Bader Ginsburg">
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Ruth Bader Ginsburg is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Ginsburg was appointed
          by
          President Bill Clinton and took the oath of office on August 10, 1993. She is the second female justice (after
          Sandra Day O'Connor) of four to be confirmed to the court. She is generally viewed as belonging to the liberal
          wing of the court. Ginsburg has received attention in American popular culture for her fiery liberal dissents
          and
          refusal to step down; she has been dubbed the "Notorious R.B.G."
        </p>

        <p>
          Ginsburg earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell University, and became a wife and mother before starting law
          school at Harvard, where she was one of the few women in her class. She transferred to Columbia Law School,
          where
          she graduated tied for first in her class.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ginsburg spent a considerable part of her legal career as an advocate for the advancement of gender equality
          and
          women's rights, winning multiple victories arguing before the Supreme Court. She advocated as a volunteer
          lawyer
          for the American Civil Liberties Union and was a member of its board of directors and one of its general
          counsels
          in the 1970s.

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Condoleezza Rice (born November 14, 1954) is an American diplomat and political scientist who is the current
          director of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. A member of the Republican Party, she previously
          served
          as the 66th United States secretary of state from 2005 to 2009 and as the 19th U.S. national security advisor
          from
          2001 to 2005. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state and the first woman to serve as
          national security advisor. Until the election of Barack Obama as president in 2008, Rice and her predecessor,
          Colin Powell, were the highest-ranking African Americans in the history of the federal executive branch (by
          virtue
          of the secretary of state standing fourth in the presidential line of succession). At the time of her
          appointment
          as Secretary of State, Rice was the highest-ranking woman in the history of the United States to be in the
          presidential line of succession.</p>

        <p>Rice was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and grew up while the South was racially segregated. She obtained her
          bachelor's degree from the University of Denver and her master's degree in political science from the
          University
          of Notre Dame. In 1981, she received a PhD from the School of International Studies at the University of
          Denver.
          She worked at the State Department under the Carter administration and served on the National Security Council
          as
          the Soviet and Eastern Europe affairs advisor to President George H. W. Bush during the dissolution of the
          Soviet
          Union and German reunification from 1989 to 1991. On December 17, 2000, she joined the Bush administration as
          President George W. Bush's national security advisor. In Bush's second term, she succeeded Colin Powell as
          Secretary of State, thereby becoming the first African-American woman, second African-American after Powell,
          and
          second woman after Madeleine Albright to hold this office.</p>

        <p>
          Hillary Rodham Clinton is an American politician, diplomat, lawyer, writer, and public speaker. She served as
          the
          First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, 67th United
          States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, and as the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United
          States in the 2016 election.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clinton graduated from Wellesley College in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1973. After
          serving as a congressional legal counsel, she moved to Arkansas and married Bill Clinton in 1975. In 1977, she
          co-founded Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families. She was appointed the first female chair of the Legal
          Services Corporation in 1978, and became the first female partner at Little Rock's Rose Law Firm the following
          year. As First Lady of Arkansas, she led a task force whose recommendations helped reform Arkansas's public
          schools.
        </p>

        <p>
          As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an advocate for gender equality and healthcare reform. In
          2000,
          Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York, and was reelected to the Senate in 2006. She
          unsuccessfully ran for President in 2008, losing the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama. She then served as
          the
          U.S. Secretary of State in the Obama Administration from 2009 to 2013.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clinton made a second presidential run in 2016. She received the most votes and primary delegates in the 2016
          Democratic primaries, and formally accepted her party's nomination for President of the United States on July
          28,
          2016. She became the first female candidate to be nominated for president by a major U.S. political party. She
          lost the presidential election in the Electoral College, despite winning a plurality of the popular vote. She
          received more than 65 million votes, the 3rd-highest count in a U.S. presidential election, behind Obama's
          victories in 2008 and 2012.

      <div>
        <p>Marsha P. Johnson, along with Sylvia Rivera and other transgender and gender non-conforming people of color,
          has been credited with starting the infamous Stonewall Uprising of 1969. When police raided the Stonewall Inn,
          a gay bar in New York City, in June of that year — as they had many times before — Johnson and others who were
          there that night decided they'd had enough and fought back. The ensuing protest lasted six days and is
          considered the start of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. The first Pride parade was held in June of the
          following year to commemorate the uprising.

          After Stonewall, Johnson continued her activist work and co-founded the Street Transvestite Action
          Revolutionaries (STAR) House with Rivera. The two women, who were both sex workers and homeless for much of
          their lives, saw that the needs of gender non-conforming and homeless youth weren't being met by gay rights
          groups of the day and started STAR House in response. It was the first LGBTQ+ youth shelter in the U.S. and
          the first organization led by trans women of color.

          In the wake of the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, Johnson became caregiver to friend and fellow activist Randy
          Wicker's lover. Her connection to the community led Johnson to attend early meetings of AIDS advocacy group
          ACT UP. She was an outspoken activist for people with AIDS, transgender people, and homeless youth until her
          death in 1992.</p>

          Eleanor Roosevelt was an American political figure, diplomat and activist. She served as the First Lady of the

          to the United Nations General Assembly from 1945 to 1952.
        </p>

          Though widely respected in her later years, Roosevelt was a controversial First Lady at the time for her
          outspokenness, particularly her stance on racial issues. She was the first presidential spouse to hold regular
          press conferences, write a daily newspaper column, write a monthly magazine column, host a weekly radio show,
          and
          speak at a national party convention. On a few occasions, she publicly disagreed with her husband's policies.

        <p>
          Following her husband's death in 1945, Roosevelt remained active in politics for the remaining 17 years of her

          Lili Ilse Elvenes, better known as Lili Elbe, was a Danish painter, trans woman and among the early recipients
          of gender-affirming surgery.

          Though she became famous as a painter under her legal name, Einar Wegener, in 1930 she changed her legal name
          to Lili Ilse Elvenes (later adopting the surname Elbe), and stopped painting after transitioning. Earlier that
          year, she traveled to Germany for gender affirmation surgery–highly experimental at the time. She endured four
          surgeries, including a uterus transplant. Unfortunately, Lili’s immune system rejected the transplant, and she
          died from cardiac arrest due to infection just three months after her last surgery.
