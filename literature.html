        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Simone de Beauvoir was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist
          and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on
          both
          feminist existentialism and feminist theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social
          issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a
          foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels, including <em>She Came to Stay</em> and
          <em>The Mandarins</em>.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Betty Friedan was an American feminist writer and activist. A leading figure in the women's movement in the
          United States, her 1963 book <em>The Feminine Mystique</em> is often credited with sparking the second wave of
          American
          feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the National
          Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women "into the mainstream of American society now [in]
          fully
          equal partnership with men."
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarded as an influential author and intellectual in the United States, Friedan remained active in politics
          and
          advocacy until the late 1990s, authoring six books.

      <div>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Maya Angelou was an American poet, singer, memoirist, and civil rights activist. She published seven
          autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies,
          and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees.
          Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult
          experiences. The first, <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em> (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17
          and
          brought her international recognition and acclaim.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the publication of <em>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</em>, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her
          personal
          life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a
          defense of black culture. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography
          by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family
          and
          travel.

          for
          Fiction. An avowed feminist, Walker coined the term "womanist" to mean "A black feminist or feminist of color"
          in 1983.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Audre Lorde was an American writer, feminist, womanist, librarian, and civil rights activist. As a poet, she
          is
          best known for technical mastery and emotional expression, as well as her poems that express anger and outrage
          at civil and social injustices she observed throughout her life. Her poems and prose largely deal with issues
          related to civil rights, feminism, and the exploration of black female identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In relation to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said, "those of us who stand
          outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; those of us who have been forged in the
          crucibles of difference – those of us who are poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older – know that
          survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the
          master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own
          game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those
          women who still define the master's house as their only source of support."

      <div>
        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Virginia Woolf was an English writer, considered one of the most important modernist 20th-century authors and
          a
          pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout her life, Woolf was troubled by bouts of mental illness, which included being institutionalised and
          attempting suicide. Her illness is considered to have been bipolar disorder, for which there was no effective
          intervention at the time. Eventually in 1941 she committed suicide by putting rocks in her pockets and
          drowning
          herself in a river, at the age of 59.
        </p>
        <p>
          Woolf became one of the central subjects of the 1970s movement of feminist criticism, and her works have since
          garnered much attention and widespread commentary for "inspiring feminism", an aspect of her writing that was
          unheralded earlier. Some of her writing has been considered offensive and has been criticised for a number of
          complex and controversial views, including anti-semitism and elitism.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Jane Austen was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and
          comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the
          dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her use of
          biting irony, along with her realism, humour, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim among
          critics,
          scholars, and popular audiences alike.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          The Brontës were a nineteenth-century literary family from England. The sisters, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne,
          are
          well known as poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they originally published their
          poems
          and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories immediately attracted attention
          for their passion and originality. Charlotte's Jane Eyre was the first to know success, while Emily's
          <em>Wuthering
            Heights</em>, Anne's <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> and other works were later to be accepted as
          masterpieces of
          literature.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Emily Dickinson was an American poet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dickinson lived much of her life in reclusive isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a
          noted penchant for white clothing and became known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, to
          even
          leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most friendships between her and others depended entirely upon
          correspondence. She was a recluse for the later years of her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Dickinson was a prolific private poet, fewer than a dozen of her nearly 1,800 poems were published
          during
          her lifetime. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to
          her friends.

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Phillis Wheatley was the first published African-American female poet. Born in West Africa, she was sold into
          slavery at the age of seven or eight and transported to North America. She was purchased by the Wheatley
          family
          of Boston, who taught her to read and write and encouraged her poetry when they saw her talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wheatley was emancipated shortly after the publication of her book. She married in 1778, but after the
          inprisonment and death of her hsuband, fell into poverty and died of illness.

        <p>
          Agatha Christie was an English writer. She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story
          collections.
          Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, <em>The Mousetrap</em>, and, under the
          pen name
          Mary Westmacott, six romances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Guinness World Records lists Christie as the best-selling novelist of all time. Her novels have sold roughly 2
          billion copies, and her estate claims that her works come third in the rankings of the world's most-widely
          published books, behind only Shakespeare's works and the Bible.
